# Architecture Decision Records

## Superseded (Frappe/ERPNext era)

ADR-0001 through ADR-0005 described the original Frappe/ERPNext foundation. They are
superseded by ADR-ERP-001, which replaces ERPNext/Frappe with iDempiere as the Baobab ERP
engine. Kept for history; do not follow them for new work.

- [ADR-0001: Extend, do not fork, Frappe and ERPNext](ADR-0001-upstream-extension-model.md) — superseded by ADR-ERP-004
- [ADR-0002: Frappe site as ERP tenant isolation unit](ADR-0002-site-tenancy.md) — superseded by ADR-ERP-002/003
- [ADR-0003: Explicit canonical entity mappings to ERPNext](ADR-0003-canonical-mappings.md) — superseded by ADR-ERP-007
- [ADR-0004: REST and signed events before a broker](ADR-0004-integration-transport.md) — superseded by ADR-ERP-005/006
- [ADR-0005: MariaDB for ERPNext compatibility](ADR-0005-database.md) — superseded by ADR-ERP-008 (PostgreSQL)
